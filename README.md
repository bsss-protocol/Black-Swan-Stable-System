# Black-Swan-Stable-System
BSSS proposes, for the first time, a scalable, decentralized, and value-sharing on-chain market stability solution. It not only protects investors during crises but also provides a novel source of yield for idle capital in ordinary times. We believe stability is core to the next generation of financial infrastructure. 
BSSS is a decentralized stable protocol designed to counteract extreme market conditions in the cryptocurrency space. We construct an algorithm-driven, community-participated distributed liquidity network that automatically deploys "Stability Lines" at critical price points, effectively preventing panic-induced flash crashes and liquidity droughts. BSSS acts not only as a market shock absorber but also as public infrastructure that mobilizes idle capital across the ecosystem to maintain the stable and orderly development of the blockchain market. It is not affiliated with any single exchange; instead, it serves as a neutral stability primitive, providing a trustworthy stability layer for the entire Web3 ecosystem, ultimately evolving into a critical public good underpinning the multi-trillion dollar cryptocurrency market.

To achieve this ambitious vision, we propose a pragmatic dual-path execution strategy: rapidly validating the model and accumulating resources through the BSSS Core Engine (CEX Path), unwaveringly guiding progress towards the fully community-governed BSSS Public Protocol (DEX Path). Both paths share the same technological core and mission, ensuring we deliver stability—a public good—to the entire Web3 ecosystem in the most effective manner.
